The manuscript accompanying this script is: MAGIC: A tool for predicting transcription factors and cofactors driving gene sets using ENCODE data. Roopra, A. 2020 PLoS Computational Biology

Transcriptomic profiling is an immensely powerful hypothesis generating tool. However, accurately predicting the transcription factors (TFs) and cofactors that drive transcriptomic differences between samples is challenging.  A number of algorithms draw on ChIP-seq tracks to define TFs and cofactors behind gene changes.  These approaches assign TFs and cofactors to genes via a binary designation of ‘target’, or ‘non-target’ followed by Fisher Exact Tests to assess enrichment of TFs and cofactors.  MAGIC uses ENCODE ChIP-seq data to look for statistical enrichment of TFs and cofactors in gene bodies and flanking regions in gene lists without an a priori binary classification of genes as targets or non-targets.  When compared to other TF mining resources, MAGIC displayed favourable performance in predicting TFs and cofactors that drive gene changes 


MAGIC requires Matrix files that can be downloaded from: https://go.wisc.edu/magic
Download Matrices.zip and unpack. Place unzipped folder in the same directory/folder as MAGIC.py prior to running MAGIC.py

The current version of MAGIC  is MAGIC_1_1.  MAGIC_1_1 output is slightly different to that of MAGIC and from that described in the manuscript.  It is outlined in the tree diagram at the end of this file.

Implementation of MAGIC: A tab delimited text file is requested by MAGIC (lists file). The first column contains a list of all genes expressed in the experiment (background list). Any number of other columns are then added containing query lists. For example, a query list may be all genes that go up under some criterion and another may be all genes that go down. The first row is the header and must have unique names for each column. MAGIC then requests which Matrix to use.  There are currently 6 matrices to choose from:

1Kb_gene.mtx			
1Kb_gene_with_engineered_factors.mtx
1Kb_promoter.mtx
1Kb_promoter_with_engineered_factors.mtx
5Kb_gene.mtx
5Kb_gene_with_engineered_factors.mtx

Matrices with engineered factors are derived from 2312 ChIP-seq tracks covering 684 Factors in 588 cell lines or conditions.  Matrices without engineered Factors derive from 1923 ChIP-seq tracks covering 392 Factors in 207 cell lines or conditions.  All Matrices encompass 27,941 genes.

1Kb_gene_xxx.mtx and 5Kb_gene_xxx.mtx allow the user to study factors within 1 or 5Kb of the gene body.  1Kb_promoter_xxx.mtx limits searches to 1Kb upstream and 300bp downstream of gene promoters.

MAGIC analyzes each query list and generate a series of output files and sub-directories in the directory containing the original lists file:

- Accepted_Lists.txt :
	The original input file filtered for genes in the Matrix.

- Query_List_Details.xls:
	Statistical information for all non-triaged Factors. All Factors associated with Pcorr < 10% are highlighted in bold red. Data reported in Query_List_Details.xls are:

	Factor Name

	Description
		Format: cell line and condition_ENCODE bed file name.  e.g. T47D treated with 100 nM genistein for 1 hour_ENCFF516GZM

	Critical ChIP
		This is argDsup i.e. ChIP value at dsup (This value is used to determine target genes in the list)

	Obs Tail Mean
		Average of the 95th percentile ChIP values (n values) in the query list.

	Exp Tail Mean:
		Average of the top n ChIP values in the backgound.

         Tail Enrichment
            Ratio of the Obs and Exp Tail Means (r) Raw P

         Corrected P
            Benjamini Hochberg corrected p value (Pcorr)

	Score
		-log(Pcorr)x r

- Summary.xls 
	File with the same layout as above contains the best scoring experiment for each Factor in ENCODE  – each Factor appears once in this file.
 
- Query_list_summary.pdf
	A bar graph of Factors and Scores with Pcorr <10%.

- Query_list_Drivers.gmx
	Tab delimited file in the GMX format utilized by GSEA. The first column contains the background list of genes. The second contains the query list. Subsequent columns contain all target genes of each Factor. Target genes are defined as those genes in the query list whose ChIP signal is greater than the Critical ChIP (argDsup) i.e. the ChIP at which there is the maximal difference between the population and query cumulative.  For each Factor, target genes were gathered from all experiments that were associated with Pcorr<10%.

- CDFs (Directory)
	Graphical displays of the analysis for all non-triaged Factors. The naming format is ‘rank (integer)’_’factor (string)’.pdf (e.g. 1_NRSF.pdf; rank = 1, factor = NRSF) where ranking is determined by Score. Two cumulative functions are displayed: the black curve is the fractional cumulative of all genes in the background list against ChIP values, red is the same for query genes. A blue vertical line denotes the ChIP value at dsup i.e. argDsup. Red ticks along the x-axis represent each gene in the query list and black ticks are all genes in the background. Red ticks with circles (‘lollipops’) are the n=0.05X best chiped genes. Black lollipops are genes in the background list with the n highest ChIP values.

- Auxiliary_Files (Directory)
	This folder is populated with data behind the summary files.

- Query_list_raw_results.CSV
	Same columns as Query_list_Summary.xls file but has raw data for all factors including those that were triaged and not considered for further statistical analysis. It also contains the Kolmogorov-Smirnov D statistic for each factor. D statistics with a negative sign denote D values for triaged factors; the negative sign is used by the algorithm for triage sorting.

- Query_list_Sub_Matrix.txt
	A Matrix file filtered for genes in the query list.
      
- Triaged_Factors.txt
	List of factors that were not considered (triaged).
         
- Triaged_Genes.txt
	Genes in the query that were not in the MAGIC Matrix and therefore eliminated from analysis.

- Target Data (Directory)
	Contains comma separated text files for each Factor with Pcorr < 10%. Each file contains a list of target genes for that Factor and associated MAGIC Matrix ChIP value.  The value for each gene is the best ChIP value for that gene found across all experiments for that Factor.
